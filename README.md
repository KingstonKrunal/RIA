Relationship Information App

This app basically save your personel data and display it when you successfully registerd. My idea is to use this app in emergency like accident to show all the personel details to others when they open this app on your mobile phone to help you. This is just for study purpose.

I'm using firebase real-time database to store the data. So, you have to add google-services.json file in the project when you use this app. I've removed that file because of security reasons.
